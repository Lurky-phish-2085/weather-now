## Known issues, workarounds, and fixes

### Weather interpretation images is not visible

The weather interpretation image pack used is not optimized for the theme styled
by [Beer CSS](https://www.beercss.com).

To fix this, better always the app in dark mode.

### Stuck on loading screen or having issues in general?

Please open the web app again without any browser extensions enabled. This app
has an issue about getting blocked by certain privacy browser extensions (e.g
UBlock origin, Privacy Badger) due to api calls with the [Country API](https://country.is).
